# ðŸŽ¨ Compilation of Drawing on the Web Projects ðŸŽ¨

### Overview of projects:

*CSS Animation*\
Animated using CSS, dedicated to my favorite guy cartoon

*Javascript*\
Interactions coded in Javascript
Wait for the promp to appear and move mouse up and down to change driving speed!

*Web APIs*\
Pexels API to query an image based on a keyword and then extracted its color palette using getImageData() to manipulate the base HTML Canvas drawing to look like different planet spaces. Right now searchquery is set equal to "nepal", but "pastel", "alps", and any planet name have been fun as well!

*HTML Canvas*\
A remix of my CSS Animation, all animated using HTML Canvas

*Final Project*\
I chose to try and tackle the problem of creating unique "timers" that don't provoke anxiety. With these drawings, I created "countdown timers" that display the passage of time without bringing the anxiety of (constantly changing) numbers. Each of them will initially depict the "view" in its beginning phase, then gradually change as time passes to depict how it would naturally be on Earth (at a speed relative to the time that the user chooses). 

The mountainscape darkens and populates the sky with stars.\
The cityscape builds on itself.\
The jellyfish populate and glow.

The placement of the stars/buildings/jellyfish is determined at random based on screen dimension.\
The stars/buildings/jellyfish per amount of time and the time itself can be adjusted in the code and is made short for demo purposes.
